The cafe is above average and worth a visit. The down side is this all comes for a price. And it at least for this reviewer, it seemed that I was paying for amenities that I would never use."

Ample equipment, free weights and generally a serious trainers place. The pricing is great also. However, while Gold's is global, they are franchises and when visiting other gyms there is a guess member fee. If you are a serious lifter this should be on your short list."
